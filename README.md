# Student Lifestyle Survey - BAIS:3300 HW7 üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This assignment involved creating a web form in order to collect data about undergraduate student lifestyles. The form needed to be three pages, have many different form elements, and collect at least name and gender data. 

## How Does My Survey Conform to Best Practices? ‚úÖ
One way my web form conforms to best practices is that it does not collect information that is not necessary. This way the survey participant does not feel like they are giving out too much personal information. This includes not collecting race information and adding an option for gender that says "prefer not to say". Only collecting the information that is needed for the survey permits the best results. 

Another way that my web form conforms to best practices is that I included the use of checkboxes for one of my data collection questions. This allows the user to have options and not have to settle on a single answer. The use of text inputs also adds to the user choice in my web form. Giving the user freedom in their answers will produce results that are the best reflect of them. 

Lastly, my use of aria labels and color contrast allows my web form to conform to best practices. Making sure the web form is accessible to as many people as possible is very important. Aria labels allow the accessible name to become the string that is passed in the attribute. This label can them be read by assistive technology. Color contrast is also very important becuase if the colors are too similiar it can restrict that amoutn of users that can take your survey. I made sure that my ratio of background to foreground colors was largely above the 5:1 guidline. 

## What Did I Learn? üí≠
This assignment taught me the importance of accessibility in web forms. Making sure everyone feels comfortable taking your survey and can easily navigate the sight should be a top priority. After learning this knowledge, I made sure to carry it with me into future project in this class and the real world.
