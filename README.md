# Student Lifestyle Survey - BAIS:3300 HW7 🏃‍♀️

This assignment involved creating a web form in order to collect data about undergraduate student lifestyles. The form needed to be three pages, have many different form elements, and collect at least name and gender data. 

## How Does My Survey Conform to Best Practices? ✅
- It does not collect unnecessary information
- Utilized checkboxes and text inputs for data collection questions
- Aria labels that can be read by assistive technology
- Color contrast where ratio of background to foreground colors were largely above the 5:1 guideline. 

## What Did I Learn? 💭
This assignment taught me the importance of accessibility in web forms. Making sure everyone feels comfortable taking your survey and can easily navigate the sight should be a top priority. After learning this knowledge, I made sure to carry it with me into future project in this class and the real world.
